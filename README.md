# Twittwilio
Twittwilio - My fun mashup of Twitter and Twilio using Mule ESB.
 
#An Introduction
 
Twitter : A social media platform used by everyone across the globe to 'tweet' about what is happening around them.
 
Twilio : A telephony app used primarily to call/send text messages by using internet .
 
Now from Twitilio you would be able to send a latest tweet to your friend who is a registered twilio user just by knowing their phone number .
 
#A Scenario of Usage
 
 For instance ,you want to share the happy news about your marriage to all your friends and you tweet about it .But one of your friends is  not a social media person and is not on twitter . No worries!! Send your tweet to everyone and Just go to twitilio app enter his/her number and send your latest tweet to them .
 
This mashup also lists some of the toll free numbers to which you would be able to send out tweets as text messages .
 
If there is an emergency and you need to alert a toll-free number to send out a generic message just share that on twitter and push it via Twittwilio.
 
#PreRequisite
 
A twitter account for the sender and a valid twilio registered user as recipient.

#For Testing Purposes
 
If you are a twilio user ,you could very well send yourself the latest tweet by giving your phone number.
